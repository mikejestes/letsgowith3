Let's build out a new route to handle the pointing poker room. We will be using y js, y-webrtc and @joebobmiles/y-react packages to handle peer to peer connects and data. The poker room should have the following features:

* Leader Selection: First user becomes leader, with automatic migration possible
* State Synchronization: All state changes propagate automatically via Yjs
* Voting Privacy: Votes are hidden until leader reveals them
* Round Management: Completed rounds are archived, new rounds reset the voting state
* User Management: Online/offline status tracked automatically

Lets start with a react page to handle this, with a focus on the data schema and y-react connection management and very simple buttons.
